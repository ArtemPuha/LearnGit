				My name is Artem, I'm 25, I was born and live in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0" target="blank"> Ukraine</a>. I finished 11 classes of school and then went to college to become a ship's cook. After completing my studies, I did not work in my profession, but went to try my luck in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC" target="blank"> Vietnam</a>. There I got a job in the show room of a local coffee company and at the same time sent my resume to a travel company. To my surprise, I was hired without education as a tour guide and I flew to collect documents for flying to another country, this became <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%81" target="blank">Tunisia</a>, after which I managed to live and worked for a year and a half in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%8C%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BC" target="blank"> Vietnam</a> and then in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D1%83%D1%80%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="blank"> Turkey</a>, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%83_(%D1%81_2022)" target="blank"> war</a> put everything in its place and now I am at home and undergoing training at one of the best IT schools in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0" target="blank"> Ukraine</a>,

		<h2>My hobbies</h2>

					As a child, I was fond of basketball at the school club level, but then a computer appeared in my life and I began to get involved in computer games, which even brought me a good income of around $400-500 at the age of 14-16 and I could already exist on my own without asking for money for pocket expenses from parents. After all my travels to different countries and returning home, I began to get involved in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3" target="blank"> spin fishing</a>, which I still devote quite a lot of time to this day. I also like to play <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BC" target="blank"> Texas Hold'em</a> (this is a type of poker)
